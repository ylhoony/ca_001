i have one email, but would like to log into multiple companies
ok,
one user to many companies.
but, i do not want to maintain all the different sites.
it is different thing.
let's say i create 2 sites.

i am creating one company system - ABC company.
now, i registered the site with my email address - abc@test.com
when I create ABC company, I am generating database for ABC company
database name - dbABC.

and now i create second company system - XYZ company
with same email address.
so what do i do with the email.

there is central database only for users -
and recording which companies they are connected to.
and for each company, i need to know the database i created

so, central database, i need
- users - login info
- client companies --> should have database address
- bridge table for client company and users

i login with one email
then, i see the dashboard that i should select
which company i am going to connect.
when i select the company,
it looks for the database name and connect to it, then pull the information.

this will have advantage over the data load issue.
but, if I update the software, how do i maintain or upgrade the thousands of databases.
looking at the knex.js, as long as i know the access to the database
there should be a way to create or delete the data field systematically.

so, when deployment happens, it should include database checking.
